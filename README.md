STEPS :
  * Imported the necessary libraries and packages.
  * Loaded the dataset.
  * Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to know the spread of the data.
  * Performed Data cleaning and Preprocessing steps by removing the unwanted columns.
  * Removed the punctuations and huperlinks present in the tweets.
  * After that visualized the dataset based on the two sentiments positive and negative.
  * Splitted the dataset for training and testing.
  * For model building used two models SVM and Logistic regression.
  * Evaluated the model by using evaluation matrics like precision,recall,accuracy and confusion matrix.
  * From the above fitted models,SVM and Logistic Regression models have given the accuracy of 66% and 64% for the train and test data respectively.Hence,for the corona sentiment analysis of tweets data SVM model is proved to be the best model.
